# Code Buddy

Do you code in codeforces or any other platforms? Do you maintain repositories or folders to keep track of all the problems solved by youself in the past? Do you often think of attempting a live coding contest but forget to do so only because you were not reminded by anybody before the contest? Then you are in the right place. 

This website allows you to keep track of all the problems you solved in codeforces by saving them and also reminds you of coding contests before they begin.
